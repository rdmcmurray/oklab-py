# This function rotates through the lab color space
# A helpful visual is to imagine a circle drawn over the color square on this page:
# https://observablehq.com/@fil/oklab-color-space
# Given a value from 0-period, it returns a lab color along the circumference of the circle

	angle = (x + offset) / period * circumference
	# Chroma 0-0.5
	# Can be thought of as the radius of the circle
	# It controls how evenly the color transitions
	chroma = 0.25
	# Lightness is 0-1, black to white, so 0.5 is 100% unadulterated chroma
	# This lets us control perceived brightness without having to change the NeoPixel brightness, which would be slower

	a = chroma * math.cos(angle)
	# b is blue-yellow: 0.25 to -0.25

# Change that to linear RGB, then to RGB
# Assign all NeoPixels and display
